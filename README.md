# BitGuild
BitGuild is an open platform for creating tokenized communities, allowing creators to issue and airdrop tokens.
Anyone without a code base can complete the issuance and airdrop of tokens through fixed templates, which greatly simplifies the process of project start-up and enables the start-up of various projects to be completed at the fastest speed.
